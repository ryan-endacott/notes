Know different hashing types and efficiencies and collisions and such.

Show how binary search tree is constructed.  Simulate the algorithm rather than psuedocode.  

Same thing for red black tree, may ask a true or false or ask what is the height of a red black tree or the ratio between longest and smallest path?

Execute red-black tree stuff rather than know psuedocode.  

Very small pseudocode function:  Chapter 14 datastructure.  Rank and select of order statistic functions.  

For this chapter know:
- left turn, right turn
- jarvis marsh
- jarvis hull
- Algorithm for doing intersections - first step is sorting in increasing x order
- what is a data structure that does X?


Add a new thing for node of r/b tree.  Expect you to know what is the main qualification that we wish to look at if we want to add more r/b tree stuff.  Wide range of short answer questions.  And some execution.  Make it feasible in one hour.  

Wednesday test after break.
