# Final Exam Topics

Know execution time for all data structures.
Know english descriptions for all stuff.
Most questions will be from earlier chapters (RBT, Hashing)
No pseudocode, but lots of operations and execution.
Just kidding, small amount of pseudocode from Geometric Algorithms.

## Hashing
- Direct Access
- Linear Chaining
- Linear Probing
- Quadratic Probing
  - To make cycling not happen, you must use another method.
  - Compute formula c1i + c2i^2 mod m
  - Compute this from i is 0 up to m -1 it will be distinct numbers
- Double Hashing

No psuedocode, just know execution.

## Binary Search Tree
All operations
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Search
- Etc

##  Red Black Tree
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Sequence of insertion/deletion

Know the figure in the book.  If you know the figure, you know all of the cases.  Deletion is on page 329.  Insertion is on page 317.

No pseudocode, just know execution and cases, etc.

Types of Question:
- True/False
- short answer
- show tree that would result if you do insert/delete at a point

## Augmenting Data Structures
- Interval Tree
  - How to store
  - How does the algorithm work?
  - The type of execution, whether you go left or right, etc
  - How to search one
- Rank
- Order Statistic Select
- How to Augment

## Geometric Algorithms
- Left Turns, Right turns, clockwise, counterclockwise
- Intersection of 2 Segments
- Finding if any pair of m segments intersects (sweep technique)
- Convex Hull
  - Jarvis March
  - Graham Scan

Not focusing too much on this chapter.
