NLP == computational lingistics
(mostly equal to)

NLP is asking the machine to reason with text.

Things we want it to do:
1.  Translate oral notes to text -> grab structured data from notes -> produce analytical and narrative summary of the data.
2.  Summarize evidence and precedents in court cases.
3.  Better identification of interesting scientific papers.
  - May be interested in cell death in plants, but also want to know about molecules that appear during cell death.  Want to know if those molecules can autofluoresce yellow.
4.  Better automated translation of text.  
5.  Better human computer interaction with robots taking care of us.  

High level issues:
-  Involves text interpretation with explicit and implicit semantics.
-  And they involve reasoning with that knowledge (background and in text).
Machinery/low level issues:
-  Understand the meaning of texts of different sizes.
-  Recognize and define what it means to be similar.
