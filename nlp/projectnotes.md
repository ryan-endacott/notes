Look at an ontology for abstraction?
Ontologies provide a set-subset relationship among the ideas denoted by the term.


Ex: Sugar > lsugar, dsugar


May want to take advantage of the structure of news articles.  Important ideas up front and vs later, etc.  Abrupt topic shift.  Efforts to detect topic shifts.  Separate clusters of related concepts.


Lead paragraph has most important basic stuff.  And subsequent paragraphs go each a layer deper into the topic.

It may be that if I look at wordnet and ask if the brown corpus has terms that appear in wordnet and what their relationship is to eachother given wordnet.  And supplement it with the textrank score.  The shape of the graph for textrank may be modular.  It may be that there are clusters.

Gilbert Youmans text statistic stuff.  He wrote code to detect shifts in topic in literature.  Try poking in some of my text and seeing if I see something.


Try different things and compare.  Must talk about a review of the relevant literature.
