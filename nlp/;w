### Information Theory from Shannon/Weaver
Awesome for really fast parsing:  Also beautiful applied math:

I(x) is information contained in event x.

Events that were certain carry no information.

The more possible events, the more information is carried.
Flipping a coin carries less info that tossing a die.

The more events the more info.
If x and y are independent, then I(x & y) = I(x) + I(y)


Suppose you have a coin toss (2 possibilities) and a die throw (6 possibilities)
