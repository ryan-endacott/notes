Friday is midterm Q&A.
Midterm example and solution is on blackboard.


For subtraction, c flag is set to the opposite of the actual last carry bit.

Big endian means that the high byte will be stored somewhere and the low byte will be stored beneath it in higher memory.  So in memory, storing $A000 will go to $A0, $00 in increasing memory order.
Ex:
If storing $A205 at $9FFF, $9FFF will be $A2, and $A000 will be $05.

When storing a number, it sets the flags.
