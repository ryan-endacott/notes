# Thomas Nagel Mind and Cosmos Chapter 1


Descartes thought that the physical world was the kind of system where you can explain things in mathematical way.  Descartes thinks the physical world, if there is one, it is subject to laws of mathematics.  And he thinks physics, astronomy, medicine, etc are in some sense developable out of mathematics.  That is a final theory of the physical world.  Everything that happens in the physical world is causal products of the other things in the world.  He is talking about the nonhuman objects in the physical world.


It was a giant extrapolation from that relatively limited sample.  (Our solar system is a very small part of the universe, so the sample is limited.  Secondly, our time sample of the universe is really small as well.)  That is a huge extrapolation from our success in using mathematics in some areas to view that the whole universe is mathematically describable.


One of Nagel's targets in this chapter is the assumption that when you add human beings to the mix, you don't have to modify that extreme or gross extrapolation.  You can still hold onto that.  And that is what the reductionists are asserting.  Human beings are ultimately mathematically describable, b/c biology is reducable to chemistry/physics, which are reducible to mathematics.  So we have a single principle for understanding the entire universe.

Nagel thinks that is an extremely implausible extrapolation, not for the sample size reason, but for the reason that human beings seem to be an exception to that kind of picture.  The very kind of things that Wittgenstein was interested in, minds, meaning, ethics, Nagel is not willing to treat them the way Wittgenstein did.  Nagel thinks our ethical beliefs are true or false, they do connect with the world, and he's not at all confident that they can be reduced to math.  He thinks reductionism isn't successfuly and never will be in providing a single framework for understanding the universe.  What Nagel wants to say in contrast to that single framework is that IF there is a single framework to be achieved, that framework will have to include minds, meanings, and values in what is the way to understand how things and events transpire in the universe.


So, in other words, the single view of the universe that Nagel thinks we probably need is one that goes beyond physics, beyond mathematics, and includes the things that reductionists have tried to reduce to math and physics and chemistry: meanings, values, mental states, etc.

Reductionists want to reduce everything to single framework: math.

Nagel says the universe has minds in it.

He is not a cartesian - he is not saying his heart beats with Descartes.  Except that minds are different from physical things.  And he doesn't think minds can come from merely physical things.

And that's why a complete theory of the universe has to include something mental or intelligent in order for there to be intelligent beings in the universe.

You cannot get life from merely physical things.  The possibility had to be somehow included in the universe before the arrival of living beings.  It would reveal mind and reason as basic aspects of a non-materialistic natural order.

He is saying you will not get those things unless mind and reason were somehow basic aspects of a non-materialistic world order from the getgo.  He is not knocking that there is a materialistic natural order.  He is saying that cannot be the only thing.


Causes must be something other than materialistic.  We have to have mind and reason as basic aspects of a non-material order.

Nagel knows perfectly well and makes clear that the religious person is going to say 'of course, minds had to come from God.'

Nagel says that he is not asserting that.  God is outside the universe.  He is looking for a comprehensive theory about the universe that is generated from within the universe completely.  So the God supposition, though it does give him a source of 'mind', it is rejected by him on the grounds that when he talks about a comprehensive theory of the universe, he is talking about that, not a theory outside the universe (God).


Darwin set the ball rolling, partly because he didn't have genetics available to him.


If you're a materialist, it must look like an accident that consciousness comes out of evolution.  But if you supplement this materialism with a richer view of basic elements on the universe, you understand how it is non-accidental how conscious beings arise from the universe.


He is giving us a system within the universe, not talking about how the universe came into existence.


Nagel says that the world cannot be contained in the merely physical.  Where Don says that eyecolor and haircolor can.  Don is dissenting on this point.  Not from the point that intelligence had to be there in some form from the get-go.  But that it had to be there in some way from the get-go.  Don thinks Nagel is saying that it looks accidental that certain traits appear when they are not in the causes.  Darwinian theories say that you can start with slush and sunlight and get something more gazillions of years later.  Nagel says that the extra stuff had to be there since the beginning in some non-material way.  Don disagrees and says they can be there in purely physical form.  Nagel has trouble with that idea.  Don thinks he is right to ask the question, and is right to say that potentially what emerges in the history of the universe had to in some sense been there since the beginning.  But the form in which it has to be there is not determined, whereas Nagel takes it to mean that intelligence had to somehow be there already.

Emergent qualities.  Emergence is a doctrine that new things emerge that were not necessarily predictable from what came before.  Nagel is saying that if you are going to have consciousness in the universe, it is predictable, and Nagel says the purely physical story is not a good cause.  Nagel thinks this way.

Nagel thinks that you must have already had consciousness in the universe.  He doesn't think it can arise from purely physical things.


Note: May all be facts facts facts, but it is important to distinguish what kinds of facts.  Not just materialist facts.
