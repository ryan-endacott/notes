# Proof of God's Existence

Descartes has the idea of god, but D is not


Descartes is looking for absolute certainty that we really don't look for anymore.

He wants to validate that the framework we are going to adopt for doing science is infallible.

He wants to prove we can treat the universe as mathematically describable.

Shifted away from Descartes quest for certainty.  Descartes quest for certainty is rare, but still alive in the Church.

Something cannot come from nothing.  An effect can be more perfect than its cause.


Descartes perfection scale:
- God
- Angels
- Humans
- line here for willing beings vs lacking will
- animals
- plants
- stones

Our will is almost identical to God's will, but we cannot do whatever we want, but God can.  God has unlimited power.

Something more perfect can yield something less perfect but not vice versa.

Thought principles were unexceptionable uncontroversial principles good as gold.

Descartes not perfect, but has the idea of perfection.

If he judges himself as imperfect, then he has the idea of perfection.  He has to know that he is less than possible.

Plato - If I judge things unequal, I must have the idea of equality.


Idea of perfection has to have a cause.

Ideas cannot come from lesser ideas, lesser ideas come from greater.

Perfect being has to generate idea of perfect being, and because Descartes has the idea of a perfect being, there has to be a perfect being.  i.e. God.

Everything has a cause, there are no uncaused things.

True given:
- Something cannot come from nothing.
- An effect cannot be more perfect than its cause

Hole:
- What caused God?
- Goes against first bullet above.
