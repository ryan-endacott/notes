# Descartes 4th and 5th meditation


Descartes feels he is on the sure road to certainty and the sure road is a matter of making sure that when he consults his intellect, he focuses on what the intellect delivers to him clearly and distinctly.  If he never falters away from those clear and distinct things he will never go wrong.


Descartes thinks some ideas are necessarily connected and some are not necessarily connected.  He talks about a winged horse.  He says that is an idea we make by putting wings on horses in drawings, statues, etc.

We can also disassemble things.  We can put together new ideas from old ones.

In the beginning of the 5th, Descartes says that there are some mathematical ideas which we find in our minds to be necessarily connected.  We literally cannot think except in accord with those necessary connections.  So we cannot conceive a mountain without a valley (incline w/o decline).  We can't conceive 2 + 3 being anything but 5.  And Descartes says his mind cannot make necessarily connected ideas, it takes an infinite mind to do that.  So amongst all our ideas, we find some that are inseparable from one another.  Those necessarily connected ideas could not have been made by me.  The only other source he considers is God.


The point that he then can draw from the fact that God who is benevolent put these ideas into me is that these ideas accord with how a good god wants me to think.  And that makes them in accord with His will, which makes them true at least in the sense that they accord with something outside me.  Namely god's volition.

If we know that necessarily connected ideas come from a good god, then we know that our necessarily connected ideas conform to what that good god wants us to think.  And if truth is conformity b/w ideas and things, then we here have conformity between necessarily connected ideas and god's will.



Mathematics doesn't depend on bodies.  But if there are bodies and they are mathematical, then we know our ideas are descriptive.


Why do we make mistakes?  We have an overactive will.  - Descartes


Descartes says be very careful when you make judgement.  Make sure the evidence warrants the judgements you make.  The most frequent source of error is that we make judgements on the basis of insufficient evidence.

He is wondering why we make mistakes if we were created by perfect god.  He says it is his own fault b/c he judges on too little evidence.

Now Descartes has certainty outside himself.


Things that are necessarily connected:
- All of arithmetic and geometry
- Mountain and Valley
- God and Existence
- Body and extended and divisible
- Mind as thinking and indivisible


Descartes is saying we need a better match between our will and the evidence with which we're operating.  Only ascent when the evidence is unassailable.

Descartes says he can only judge if he is certain.  It is only if he sees necessary connections.  In 6th meditation, Descartes settles for less than certainty when it comes to the facts of the world.  It's the world book, there are no necessary truths within it.


Descartes announces in the title of the 5th meditation that he is going to discuss the essence of physical things and their mathematical nature.  Then he is going to give another proof of god's existence.

You cannot have the essence of god without existence.  Whenever Descartes thinks of god, he has to think of god as existing b/c it is part of his essence.

When Descartes talks about taking the idea of god, he takes an idea that is complex (different components, omniscience, omnipotence) and another component is existence.  So the idea of God includes the idea of existence necessarily, so the result is that whenever Descartes thinks of God, then he has to be thinking of him as existing.  And Descartes now raises the mountain/valley objection:  "Just because I cannot think of a mountain without a valley, that does not mean that mountains exist."    Thinking isn't believing.  Because you are required to think in certain ways does not mandate that things you think are true.

Just because you have to think of god as existing does not show that god has to exist.  But Descartes says the idea of god contains the idea of existing so therefore god must exist.  Don doesn't like this reasoning.  Pointing out that the idea of god is unique doesn't answer the question: "Is there conformity b/w ideas and things in this case?"


Descartes thinks he can answer the objection.  Just b/c he thinks something exists, doesn't mean it exists.  Then he goes on to say that from the fact that he cannot think of god without existing.  Then he says existence is inseparable from god, so god must exist.  He says the existence of god determines his thinking.  God's necessary existence gave Descartes the idea of God as necessarily existing.

You cannot go from idea to thing.  But in the god case he says he has an idea that has existence as a part of it.  He asserts that god's necessary existence gives him the idea of a god that exists.  He isn't going from the idea to the thing.
