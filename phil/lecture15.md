# Descartes first meditation continued

As I understand Descartes, he drops the problem "how distinguish awake from sleeping", then he steers away from that and says, let's assume I am asleep.  Then see what knowledge can be attained.  - Don

Descartes compares himself to a painter.  He points out the different kinds of paintings we can make.

All paintings have one nonthing in common. They are all complexes of paints upon the canvas.  And now if you want to shift to structure, all the paintings have in common is that there are complexes of elements upon the canvas. You have simple elements on the pallette (sp?) and you transfer them to the canvas.  And every painting has that in common - it is a complex of simples.  - Don


Descartes says that in dreaming, we make images for ourselves while we are asleep.  The images are complexes of simple elements, just as the painter makes complexes of paints into the pictures.

Descartes also adds another significant comment.  It is both about paintings and about dreams.  According to Descartes, the particular complexes that the painter makes, and the particular images that the dreamer makes, may fail or succeed in representing a combination of elements in reality.

It is the apologies of a politician who has been locked up in jail.

We need to distinguish true and false representations or reality.

Just as a painting may represent a reality that didn't occur, so may a dream.  But the elements may correspond to elements in reality.


Descartes is telling us that in the case of the sleeper's mind, the dreamer takes elements of size, number, place, position, etc, and combines those and makes an image of a tree.  All mathematical elements.

Descartes is saying that the sciences that depend on complexes of mathematical element (physics, you must know about particular bodies; medicine, complexes of particles in our bodies; etc) may fail to represent the real world.

But the simples cannot fail. The sciences about the simples (arithmetic and geometry) were not good.


Descartes is putting his view in front of us with full sincerity.  He doesn't realize how at odds that view is with our everyday view of the world.


Descartes introduces a new evil genius idea.  This evil genius would warp our view of the world and inflict us with the wrong ideas from the beginning.  Those ideas would be wrong.


The way in which a demon could deceive us by creating us with the mathematical convictions we have, but there is nothing for those convictions to correspond to.  They are fictitious and false.

Well what would it be for those to be real and true?  There would be a physical world that our mathematical thinking accurately corresponds to and represents.

In other words, the demon is a way of talking about a world with just Descartes and the demon.  And descartes has the convictions about math but they don't correspond with any reality.

A good god creates descartes with the same convictions but also creates a world that corresponds to the mathematical convictions.

Wittgenstein and Descartes think about truth and falsity in the same way because they both believe in representations.


So, Descartes now does something by introducing the theological question: Are we in a demon-created world or a god-created world? And he says a lot of stuff turns on that decision.  He says the only way he can achieve in the effort to show the foundation for science is for a god to exist.

He wants to put us on a road for a firm foundation for science, and he says to get there one has to first prove that a good god exists.

There is also something as this meditation ends about probability and how his everyday opinions return to him.  D wants absolute certainty.  A trouble with probability is sometimes you can't settle matters with certainty. Notice how we talk about finding innocence or guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, not all doubt.

D wants to say that we live in a world in our everyday lives of reasonable doubt and high probability.

What Don wants to call to our attention is that of course our everyday beliefs return to us. When we are doing philosophy, engaged in this esoteric activity, we can have a set of standards for certainty that are extraordinarily high.   When we return to real life we can go back to normal.

In other words, we are not expected to be skeptical all of the time.

Descartes wants to remind you that this is a philosophical enterprise not an everyday enterprise.  Return to your normal life and keep those aside even though by habit they keep coming back to us.

Keep distinct your everyday lives and your philosophical enquiries.


Descartes says that the idea of god must come from god.

There cannot be more blank in the effect than there is in the cause of that effect.

So how does that apply to god?  The idea of a god is the idea of a perfect, all-good, all-powerful, all-knowing being.  I, Descartes, am hardly perfect.  I make mistakes, I have to learn, I'm not all powerful.  I am not god.  If I have the idea of a perfect being within me, ultimately that idea has to have come from god himself because I don't have enough perfection to generate the idea of perfection. It takes a perfect being to generate perfection.

Because if imperfection could cause perfection, that would violate the causal effect above.
