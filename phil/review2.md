Review Monk book and Lecture on Ethics.

World view of Tractatus.  Everything is in ordinary language in the lecture on ethics.  W is holding onto the world view of the tractatus but isn't super insistent on the language view presented in tractatus.  That stuff has disappeared in lecture of ethics.  But the paper on logical form tries to fix the tractatus.  The lecture on ethics tries to give W's overall world view, not his views on language so much, and where ethics doesn't fit and therefore where if it is anything it must fit.

Compare early and later W.  That will be the essay question.

Descartes talks about a painter making a painting out of colors.  So imagine a tree.  And then he talks about a dreamer making an image of the physical world.  And what he says is the painter makes a complex of these elements (colors).  Descartes says we are dreaming very much like painters.  We make images of the physical world for ourselves and then he tells us what the elements of our images are.  And he says the elements of our dream images are mathematical elements (sizes, shapes, locations) and that implies some sort of spatial grid.

The simple complex distinction is one thing.  The simple complex distinction among colors is different from the simple complex distinction among colors.

He is making a point about simples and complexes that doesn't depend on what the material is.  And here is why that is so important in connection with W.  I've told you that W says if in pursuing logic, we ever get into the position where we have to look at the world, we're completely on the wrong track.  He is talking about the logic of the world independently of the content of the world.

So when he says at beginning of Tractatus that world is facts facts facts.  He is not looking at content of the world.  He is telling us that the simplest things in the world are facts.

If you think about it, that idea is present in a subdued manner in the lecture on ethics. The important point about the world book for W is that it consists of fff.  Ethics is not facts, therefore ethics does not show up in the world book.  W views that as a logical point that whatever the actual facts and whatever the actual ethics may be (if any) the important thing is that ethics involves universal necessary eternal truths and facts are just clockable occurrences in the universe.  You don't need to know any moral commandments or any facts to know that.  It's a statement about the nature of the world without giving any specifics about the content of the world.  Vs a classificatory statement about ethics without giving specifics.  It is almost totally content independent.


D says all people die by 150 and that is a fact about human beings.  But it isn't true anymore that all people are dead by 103. There are facts that are variable (so the average lifespan is constantly increasing).  So we have facts that are contingent and could be different.  And then we have logical facts (W would not like to say that).  Either a proposition or its denial is true. That's a quasi fact.  It won't be in the world book but it will be shown by the world book.  Another way of saying there are no contradictions in our world.  Tempting to call that a fact, but then W says you will be in an endless loop.  Logic shows itself but is never stated in a proper proposition.

The actual facts are the is/ought and the logical facts are the always/everywhere.

Signs vs symbols distinction.  Signs are language like words and symbol is a representation of something in the world.

Sign becomes a symbol when it begins to represent something in the world.

A sign is a mark or a sound.  A sign becomes a symbol when you know to what the mark or sound refers.  Then it is a symbol.  A symbol is the interpretation of a sign.


When you think about what absolute truths are you realize they are not factual in nature.  Because world is Fff.  Absolute truths are so universal, so necessary.  That they are truth regardless of the facts.  They are a different kind of truth.  And that is part of why they're not in the world book.  Because absolute truth aren't amongst the facts in the world book.  Therefore they must be in a different place if there are such things.

Facts are contingent upon objects being combined in a certain way.  For early W, every combination of objects could be a different combination of objects.

We work with familiar objects.  Mermaids are imagined combinations of familiar objects.

For later W, in 1929, he says "I used to believe that the world had complex (molecular) combinations of facts and then atomic facts (combos of objects but not facts).  And each atomic fact was independent of every other fact.  He was clearly thinking of atomic facts like atoms.  They were all independent of one another even though they could be combined."  In 1929 he comes to think that a place having a certain color is an atomic fact, but it excludes other atomic facts.  He viewed that as a logical fact, but that means the atomic facts are not independent.

Then he introduced a new sign, exclusion, to talk about the certain atomicity of facts.  The exclusion that W added to the universe as a logical sign was a function of the content of the universe.  And that means that the tractatus project was not workable in a different way because now logic DID take into account the content of the universe, something W denied in the tractatus.

There is no interest with later W on fitting our language into a logical schema.  If you want to see how we use language, look and see.  Don't use some prefabricated conception that all propositions have to fit into a logical schema, bla bla bla.  That is allegedly because some propositions don't even use language.


Moral imperatives are absolute truths. A true moral imperative for W is an absolute, universal, necessary truth.  No exceptions.
Moral imperative ex: "lying is always wrong."

The ten commandments notion of moral truth.

The fact/value distinction:
Imagine that you and I are a pair of angels.  So we're looking at planet earth.  And we're looking at millions of people and here we are looking down from heaven.  And we say they ought never to lie.  Or if we're talking about the creation, we're going to create a universe in which people if god makes them, if there are any, ought never to lie.  "People, if there are any, ought never to lie."  This conveys that lying is always and everywhere wrong, no matter what the facts are.  And that is one way in which values are different from facts.  They are always/everywhere true even if there were no facts.  That's a way of indicating how morality is something different from the world.

The value is the 'should' as opposed to is or is not.  And that is why it is called the fact/value or is/ought distinction.  One ought is not a matter of how things are, it is a matter of how things should be regardless of what the facts are.

Oughtness and shouldness and goodness are not part of the world.  They are not clockable facts.

Is/Are is singular vs plural.  This thing is this way, are all things this way?


There are facts about individual things and groups of all things.  One individual and then when you have many you can form generalities.  Average lifespan vs each person.

"I'll teach you differences":  Making distinctions is important at every stage of W's life.  When W says things like "Logic is not a sayable subject matter because it has no content even though it expresses something important.  Ethics is not sayable but it doesn't get at facts in the world."  He is trying to get you to notice certain distinctions.  W says 'pay attention to your nonsense.'
"Philosophy is the art of making distinctions." - Don's old teacher
Philosophy is about figuring out how to make distinctions in clear ways.  W wants to teach you how to see the distinctions and differences.
