# Thomas Nagel Mind and Cosmos Chapter 2


Nagel has a big connection to Searle, Strawson, and Sartre (Sartre rarely looks at determinism).

Searle thinks that problem (how things are both determined and not determined) is not necessarily solvable.  He just thinks it is how it is.

Nagel thinks there is a possible solution even if we don't have one now.  He thinks we will be able to reconceive the universe and our place in it.


There are different ways to respond to puzzles.  Nagel is very optimistic about having an all-encompassing picture someday for this problem.  Searle says philosophers have been struggling with this for 2k years so we won't solve it.

It may just be that with Strawson we have to accept we take different standpoints and the world looks differently depending on the standpoint.



Nagel doesn't talk much about free will.  He is more content with determinism and is more agitated that we get an explanation of how consciousness came to be.  Searle is almost just the opposite.  He thinks consciousness comes from evolutionary factors.  But once it has arrived, he sees us as working with evolutionarily determined attitudes but we are still free.


Nagel says it is possible that the world is as follows:  Things go along, evolution occurs, and low-level life appears and then it continues to develop into beings with consciousness and people, etc.  And he says he realizes that a lot of people think that consciousness just appears when you reach a certain level of physical complexity.  Nagel says if that is the account you give, the appearance of consciousness is an accident.  He says horsefeathers, that would mean we have universe laws that make consciousness appear at a certain level of physical complexity.  Nagel says in order to prevent the accidental appearance of consciousness in the universe, you must have already had consciousness somewhere in the universe.


Nagel talks about accidents in history of universe.

If there are laws to the effect that create consciousness, then there must have been something about the universe that made it plausible that those laws exist.  But Don doesn't know if the law had to exist before it happened.  Nagel thinks that it did have to.


There are limits to solving some problems.



We sometimes talk or think teleologically.
