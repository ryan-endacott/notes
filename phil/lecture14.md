# Descartes First Meditation

These six meditations are in the middle of D's work.  He sent them around to intellectuals before publishing them.

In a later work, D tried to derive ethics from physics but died first.

## How does D end the doubt and begin believing?


## Distinction between arithmetic and geometry (math) vs physics, astronomy, medicine, etc

This is another manifestation of simple/complex distinction.

A triangle on the board is an actual triangle.  Geometry is about _all_ triangles.  So in principle you can do Geometry even if there are no Geometrical objects just as in principle you can do 2 + 3 = 5 even if you don't have a particular pair or trio in front of you.  You do not need the objects to talk about their logical axioms.

And so some people said mathematicals scarcely require whether something exists.

D says that math is about simple quantitative elements, but Physics, Astronomy, and Medicine are about complex mathematically describable objects.  So we are seeing in a new fashion someone who wants to distinguish simple from complex.

What he also wants to say is that physics, astronomy, medicine cannot exist without existing complexes of the simple elements.

So we have the simple/complex distinction being reused here.  And what goes along with it is that existing objects are required vs no existing objects are required.

Other sciences build off of math.  They have to do with complexes of the simples that math talks about.


## How can math always be true?

If you've read the first meditation, you know that Descartes says they are priveleged truth.

Everyday circumstances are variable but we cannot even think that 2 + 3 != 5

Off the top of our heads, they are universally and necessarily true. We cannot even think of them not being true.

Whether I am awake or asleep, I cannot help but think 2 + 3 = 5, square has 4 sides, etc.  These truths seem to be indubitable.  -Descartes

Indubitable applies to math.  When you think about those topics, you _have_ to think in certain ways, you _can't_ think in other ways.  So one is tempted to conclude that it must be true.

Descartes also says that under certain circumstances he may be wrong about the truth of those mathematical claims.  If there is a demon, he implants in our mind certain beliefs.  The mathematically true claims plus indubitability plus conviction.  So on this account that I exist and there is an evil genius planting thoughts in my mind.  It is possible that I have all those math beliefs that are indubitable to me and as far as I can tell they are true BUT they are not true because an evil genius put them in me and he is out to deceive me and play with my mind.  And thus I have these convictions about indubitable truths that can be false.  So now indubitability is not a sure mark of truth, though I thought it was.

The demon can give indubitable truths that are false.

Now, why call those indubitable claims false in this scenario?  The reason is that Descartes has a different scenario in mind.  On the other scenario, there is a good god plus physical world (existence of bodies).  On this scenario, a good god gives me those same math beliefs that are indubitable and I am fully convinced of.  And that is what he wants me to believe.  Notice now that my beliefs on this scenario about math are in conformity with what a good god wants me to believe.  So my beliefs conform to god's volitions.  My beliefs are what a good god wants me to believe.  So my convictions are in accordance with a good god's willings.

There is a correspondence between mathematics and me and this good being.  So math is true in the sense that it corresponds to something outside of my mind.  Which doesn't happen in the other scenario.

Descartes defines truth as conformity of ideas to thing (in this case, what god wants me to believe).  So if truth is conformity is something in me to a thing outside me.  Then I have got that kind of truth with a good god and I don't have that kind of truth with an evil demon.

Then math is true when Descartes proves there is a god.

The other thing a good god does is when he gives us beliefs that have application to a physical world.  When we have beliefs that correspond to a good god and we have a great inclination to believe that there is a physical world.  Descartes concludes that god would create a physical world that follows our math beliefs.  So we have a second instance of math ideas to something outside.  First we have ideas conforming to god.  Then the ideas conforming to physical world.

So now we have a tripartite conformity.  I have these math ideas because god gave them to me.  He is a good god who wouldn't mess with me.  They lead me to think of a physical world.  Good god would create that world.  Therefore I must conclude that math is true in the sense that it is given to me by god and it conforms to god's volitions.  And math truths correspond to a physical world that is mathematically describable.  So there is a second way in which it is true.


## Dreaming vs waking

He does say that he cannot distinguish whether he is awake or asleep.  And he does go on to say that he is going to suppose he is asleep.  I don't think he says he is asleep because of the difficulty of the situation.  He doesn't conclude he is sleeping b/c he can't distinguish b/w waking and sleeping.  He assumes he is sleeping because he wants to know what things he can know even if he is sleeping.

## Prisoner vs sliding back into old opinions

## Why teach someone like Descartes?

Philosophers are always extra inclined to look at their history.  Some people feel that it is really important to expose students to some system of philosophy in an intro to philosophy course.  Plato, descartes or kant, etc.  But some fairly developed system of philosophy.

If I were Wittgenstein, I would call it the Ideal Language (IL) vs ordinary, everyday language.

True certainty is very difficult.  In some matters, we have evidence and counter evidence and we cannot always come up with a neat answer.  Sometimes we have to make a decision.  Sometimes we can procrastinate. It raises some issues of certainty, probability, definitiveness, etc.  This is important to Descartes because when he is alive there is a prominent debate about earth orbiting the sun vs earth as motionless center of the universe.

Galileo and Copernicus are on one side arguing that yes, the earth is a moving object.  And the catholic church says NO NO NO NO.

Galileo is trying to separate science from the church, and the church is trying to hold onto its position of an authority on science and cosmology.

There is a raging debate.  Galileo was confined to house arrest after being interrogated by the catholic church.

Descartes did not want that to happen to himself.

One of the things D says in the first meditation is that he got a lot of conflicting info from his teachers.

## What are you going to do when the experts disagree?

## Expert belief vs everyday belief

We can be sure of some things in everyday life that might not be true from an expert opinion.

There is a constrast between expert belief and everyday belief.

Descartes sets as his standard for knowledge, for addressing disputes, his standard is absolute certainty, whatever that is.  It is a kind of infallibility but he doesn't use that word.  And what he wants to say is don't confuse the absolute certainty that I seek with the everyday claims of knowledge that we make.

Descartes wants to say that he is a prisoner of his own standard for truth.  He wants absolute certainty or else the claim that there is no such certainty.  But ideally he would like a list of certainties, and he doesn't want to fall back on everyday belief.  Because too many everyday beliefs have been shown to be false.  Once we have set on this quest for absolute certainty we cannot take everyday opinions.

And that is why he says he returns to his everyday standards when he stops philosophizing.  In this way, he is sliding back into old opinions.

Life is full of uncertainties.  The standard of absolute certainty is a very high standard and Descartes is insisting on it because he is looking for foundational knowledge that is basic and unassailable upon which other knowledge can be built.

Our senses sometimes deceive us.  Descartes later says in using our senses, we make mistakes sometimes.  Later he insists the mistakes are ours and not the senses.

Descartes is not talking about faith.

He wants to say that he discovers some conditions that he and you and I can get into in which we can be absolutely certain that no error is possible.  What he does is to raise doubt and then find some circumstances in which doubt is not possible as he sees it.  And that is when knowledge or belief begins.

You could read his quest for certainty as describable in this way.  Are there any circumstances in which I can be sure that no one in these circumstances be in error?  ie that I have certainty or fully warranted belief.  He finds such circumstance in the second meditation.  But he doesn't offer it up in the first meditation.

What he does is to say if you will meditate along with me, you will see in the second meditation that I claim there are circumstances in which no doubt is possible.  And certainty has been achieved.

He is famous for "Cogito, ergo sum." -> "I think, therefore I exist."

If you meditate along with him, you will see there are circumstances of thoughtfulness and you couldn't be in a state of thoughtfulness unless you were thinking.

So we now have one circumstance because if we are thinking then we must be existing.  I think, therefore I am.
