Searle your problem arises because you are looking for a single framework by which to describe human beings and you're really operating with two distinct frameworks.  One framework tells you that human behavior is determined.  The other tells you that our actions are a result of free choice.  These are contradictory, so you should make the relativizing move and say that each is true in its own framework.  And we simply live and operate in two separate frameworks.
-Strawson in chap 2.

Kant did that with just the issue that Searle is so troubled about, and if Searle were a more historically oriented philosopher he would say that.  But when you think of the self over the world we live in.  Descartes pulls the self out of the physical world.  He says we are so free that we are like god in that respect.  Selves is no so subject to math laws.  Descartes is giving us a relativized view of the self.  Our bodies are determined, but our souls are not.  And in general, that is the strategy that Strawson is proposing.  That is how he has a strong catholic element to his thinking.

He says yes there are disputes, but they are because philosophers don't realize the claims they make come from distinct perspectives or frameworks that they operate with.

In the second chapter Strawson wants to take up two views:
- There are no values in the world (Wittgenstein's lecture on ethics type of view)
- Of course there are values in the world.

We shift back and forth between these perspectives.


Colors:
Physicists:  Just see waves
Everyday:  We see colors


Strawson says recognize that we have these two pairs of perspectives and that we switch back and forth.  Some people say we should choose just one, but Strawson is very against that. "Only a self mortifying puritan would choose one."


We live in a world in which of course we have moral feelings, etc.  But there are no moral facts in the world (sorta Wittgensteinian POV).


We live in a world in which all sorts of things happen, we call them good or bad, but there is no moral trait to be found in the world.  He cannot show us the form of goodness or badness in the world.


It is subjective.  It is tied to people's judgements and choices.  But people's judgements and choices aren't made on the basis of moral qualities that are found in the world.  They are made because of upbringing, community standards, and that sort of thing.  But there is no inherent morality in the world.

Sartre says there are no values in the world, but his view is of humans determining how they are going to live a life that they are willing to value in certain ways.  So he ties value to the choices we make not to some objective moral quality.  And that is the subjectivity.


Strawson is saying that we vasselate between living in a world where values are very important.  And we argue about them, set up courts about them, set up supreme court to be final arbiter in interpretation of laws.  But that doesn't mean that we could get out our best observation equipment and find the property right wrong good bad attached to something in the world.  There are no such qualities in the world.  Those qualities get talked about when you have people and primarily when you have people.  In a metaphysical sense (sense of ultimate universe makeup) there are no values in the universe.  They are human constructs.



So Strawson believes there are no moral qualities except the ones we create?   Don wanted to say in the first chapter a big point is that we just live our lives in accord with certain claims that we can't get away from quickly or easily.  They may evolve slowly over time.  But there is no sudden reversal of our claims.  Don thinks he is saying that these two pairs of frameworks are each part of the complex story of how humans interact with the world.  Sometimes they think there are values in the world and argue about them.  And sometimes they look at the world as valueless.  And sometimes we look at the world as having colors, tastes, smells.  And other times when we are doing astronomy we are interested in distance, size, speed, etc.



Strawson believes that the physical world is devoid of moral values and that we can only talk about moral values when we're talking about human values and relations and actions and that relates to us being not just physical objects subject to scientific study.  By numbers and that kind of objectivity.


Having a country that pursues life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness makes it have an objective manifestation.  Objective standards about how that element should be pursued.


The way we see things depends on who we are.


Doctors increasingly look at us in terms of numbers and test results and decreasingly in terms of colors, verbal reports, etc.  Those are two ways of looking at the same thing.  The test one carried to the extreme has no interest in color.


Strawson says the scientific world view has a kind of all-encompassing tendency and ability to include the other views.  i.e. he says it is very tempting to explain why people hear sounds and see colors in objective scientific terms.   We can even figure out why people are so about liberty in america using science.

It is an objective fact about American subjectivity that they value freedom.


Strawson thinks that switching b/w views is part of our lives.




We live in a world where we look at different things differently.

Strawson says we go between different perspectives.  He isn't trying to avoid taking positions as he is trying to tell you how many positions he is sympathetic toward and embraces as he goes through life.
