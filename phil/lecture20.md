#  Descartes wrapup


He is interested in knowledge of god and knowledge of himself.  He says the doubts about bodies is not something that any sane person would entertain.  He says no sane person has ever doubted the existence of bodies.


Don reads Descartes as saying he knows he raises doubts about bodies.  But his motive was that when he proves bodies exist, those proofs were nothing in terms of success like the proofs that I exist and that God exists.  The discussion and doubt about bodies was put there so you can see how different our view of bodies are with our view of self and god.

Don sees Strawson as saying something like the following:
People have sought foundations for knowledge and philosophers have sought foundations for knowledge.  And sometimes that is taken to a level of 'proving' certain things (like Descartes).  Strawson adds that you have to begin somewhere with certain claims that you take to be true.  You have to begin somewhere if you are not beginning with some given claims, then you don't have a beginning point.  Strawson wants to point out that we take it as rock bottom that there are bodies, but we need somewhere to begin.  Strawson says we cannot justify it but we live with , operate with, and employ all the time.

Strawson is saying that we can claim that bodies exist, but we cannot justify that claim.  It is like an axiom in our lives.  And if we ask for justification of everything, then there will be no end of justification.  Because you can always recursively ask 'Why?'

So Strawson wants to be more practical.  He says we take some claims for granted, and secondly that we take the claim that bodies exist for granted.  Strawson is as interested in one as he is in the other.  Because taking some claim for granted is the more general form that we take the existence of bodies for granted.  He wants to say that of course we take some claims for granted, how else would we begin the conversation?

Descartes wants a certainty to derive from, and Strawson says he does have one.  Strawson says its certainty doesn't arise from perception and conception, it arises from the fact that we all take it for granted and could not operate without it.


What Descartes is saying in the end is that his proof of an external world isn't the kind of proof that he gives for his own existence and the existence of god.  Moreover, it doesn't establish the existence of bodies reliably.

Strawson says that the best explanation for our experiences is that their are bodies that cause the experiences.


In the 6th meditation, Descartes says we are aware of a close connection between mind and body.  Because if we get stabbed it hurts.

Descartes says assume there are bodies, look at what happens in the world, and you will see the close connection between mind and bodies.


Amputee can still feel foot, but this presumes bodies because of neurological connection between foot and brain.


Descartes says his proofs didn't really prove that there are bodies.  It gave a narrative of bodies interacting with bodies on the assumption that bodies exist.  No sane person would disagree with that.


Don says Descartes is saying we all assume there are bodies.  Descartes says his meditations were about god and soul.


Descartes and Strawson differ in that:
Descartes does think he is proving the _essence_ of material things.  He does think he can use his knowledge of god to prove what bodies are like.  And that does prove his foundation for seeking science because he wants to prove the physical world is mathematical.  The world is matter and motion if there is such a world.
Strawson says it is axiomatic.  We all begin with the assumption that there are bodies.  What Descartes worries about over and above that is what is the essential nature of bodies.  Strawson is silent about that.  Descartes thinks he needs god to know the nature of bodies.  Descartes thinks this because the only way he can get outside of his mind is through god.  He thinks the very nature of bodies is to be extensible, mutable, mathematical, etc.  Descartes does think he has to argue about the nature of bodies.  Strawson doesn't think that particularly b/c he is not eager to put forth a doctrine about the nature of bodies.


Strawson says that nothing he says will have bearing on religion.  He knows skepticism and naturalism are words that get used in religious discussions.  But he doesn't need to talk about religion to talk about it.  Strawson is thinking that we need to "look and see" to learn about bodies (like Wittgenstein).  To sum it up, we are getting a very different picture of foundationalism in philosophy.  This is where I begin vs this is where we begin.

So Descartes thinks there is a place where you need to give a proof of the nature of bodies in order to gain certainty.
While Strawsons is saying that we assume there are bodies, and we can find out their nature by examining the world.



*****
Don finds the last paragraph of the preface (Strawson's) to be one of the most intriguing paragraphs in philosophy that he has read.  Strawson seems to Don to say some really important things.  Some things that Don believes.  And some things that explains why philosophers are always in dispute with one another.  Here is what Strawson says about philosophy and other disciplines: "Last paragraph of preface."
Rephrased:
Other disciplines are defined by a selection of truths that constitute or found that discipline.  We say in our country with the declaration of independence that all men have rights, etc.  Then the bickering begins.  Who are men?  Just males?  Just people born in this country?  More?  Anyway, there are constituitive principles.  Things we take to be essential to some area or discipline or some nature of america.  Now he talks about agreement in those disciplines that have selected some truths as founding principles.  But Philosophy, which takes all of human thought as its field.  Truth in philosophy is so complex and multifaceted.
Kant says philosophy has to give a proof of externl world and bodies.
Strawson is saying that philosophers work with a selection of ascertainable truths and foundations and the selections can vary from philosopher to philosopher.  Because of this, there is an appearance of endemic disagreement.  This is a good thing.

Strawson is saying that disciplines other than philosophy define their discipline by their foundation.  Philosophy is about all of human thought so there is no common beginning point.  And once you understand that you will understand why there is so much disagreement.  They don't begin at the same place.


Strawson would say that he is not going to rule in or out other people's starting point.  He is ruling out that they have no starting point and that they have the same.  He is trying to get us to see that starting points can and *will* vary.  Because he is not saying there is a preferred starting point, he is saying there is no preferred starting point.
