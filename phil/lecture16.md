# Descartes's Second Meditation

Descartes is excited that he achieves a certainty in the second meditation.  He is looking for certainty and foundations for science (if there are any).  What has him gaga in the second meditation is that he has a certainty.

He discovers/realizes/determines that this certainty of the second meditation is not helpful in the way he may have originally thought.  It is not that helpful for the foundation of science.

After 2nd meditation he determines his new certainty is not sufficient for what he requires.  It isn't sufficient for getting foundations of science.

What Descartes needs to get the certainty for the foundation of science is the fact that a good god exists.

He is jubilant that he has a certainty in the second meditation but then he comes to limitations on that certainty.

Cogito, ergo sum.  "I think, therefore I am."

That is the great certainty he happens upon.  Whenever I think, I exist. He s jubilant about it.

Then he confronts himself with a puzzle.  The puzzle is "What am I?", "What is this 'I' that he knows to exist?"

We cannot detect a mind of someone else as easily as we can detect their body.  We have gazillions of examples of bodies so that if I wanted to explain to someone what a body is, I would have so many examples that I think I'd have an easier time getting across what a body is than I would getting across the idea of a mind, soul, or spirit.

Wittgenstein says sensations don't enter our language in the same way physical objects do.


Someone's mind is not as detectable as their body.  So here is what Descartes says in the 2nd half of the first meditation.

I am certain that I exist whenever I think.  What am I?  A thinking thing.  So what he says is we have the following peculiar result.  I claim to be certain about something which is very hard to describe, to show.  And I claim to be more certain of that than the objects that are familiar to all of us all the time.  Bodies.  This seems paradoxical.  In everyday life, it is easier to know bodies than minds.


Second half of the second meditation is designed to respond to that particular result.

Descartes says let's start anew and see how our result compares to the first conclusion we just came up with.

So he says let's take a piece of wax.  Put it by the fire and its properties change but its core element is the same.

When we cremate something, all of its sensible qualities disappear and are replaced by other sensible qualities.  We can express it by saying there is a complete change in sensible qualities.


Saying a body remains and saying the same body remains is not quite the same.


The important thing Descartes wants to say is that we would all say the same thing remains when we melt the wax.  It is important that nobody intervenes with the melting of wax.  It isn't tampered with or replaced.

Descartes would say he sees and judges that the same body remains.  He is shifting from an act of perception of the sensible qualities to an act of judging that there is a single thing present throughout the process.


Seeing the same wax is not to be taken literally.  He is metaphorically saying that he judges the wax is the same.


He says we look out the window and see people walking but they may be automata covered in clothing.  We don't see the people, we just judge that they are there.


Even if our judgements are erroneous, we must still exist.

We just judge that there are bodies, even though there may not be any at all.

Cogito, ergo sum is true whether or not the judgements are correct.  It is always true.  I must be thinking


Descartes approaches philosophy as "What can I know about myself, and what can I know about science?"  He didn't care much about other people.


Concept of a body is put into each human mind by god.

Descartes doesn't touch the issue about what other people see and how they judge stuff.


We don't know that objects or core essences exist because we never experience them.  We *only* judge that they exist.  And therefore we must know our mind better than bodies because we know that we exist even though our bodies may not.


We say we see bodies, but nobody has ever seen a body.  On the basis of sensible qualities, there are core essences or bodies.


We just see sensible qualities.  We don't see the underlying qualities.  We don't see the body, the extensible, flexible, mutable thing.

When Descartes say bodies are extended, flexible, mutable things in their core essence.  He is just saying they are just mathematical characterics.

When Descartes says what is a body?  And I can't imagine what a body is but I can conceive what a body is and tells us his conception of a body is an extended, flexible, mutable things.  He is giving us a new science of bodies as mathematically described.

Philosophers think the 1600s is the rise of modern science.

Read third meditation.
Key points:
- He is unsure whether bodies exist.
- Descartes has achieved a certainty in second meditation, but it isn't a certainty that Descartes finds sufficient for his foundations for a new science. He comes to think that in addition, he must prove that a good god exists. He will tell us that and tell us why he must prove so.
- At the end of the first meditation, Descartes speaks about the indubitability of arithmetic and geometry and the dubitability of arithmetic and geometry on the other hand.  On the one hand, Descartes will say that he just can't think that 2+3 is anything but 5.  He cannot imagine anything different.  If there is a demon though, he could bring it about that Descartes has to think that incorrect assumption.  One one hand there is a compulsion to believe arithmetic and geometry and on the other hand there is doubt there because of a demon.  We will see that same tension, which is related to the tension in the 2nd meditation between saying we see the same wax as if we do so and our discovering of it.  None would judge otherwise, but we could also all be wrong.
- He is going to say what gives him certainty is that he can be face to face with something.  And when he is perceiving it and not deceived then he can be sure what he sees is what he sees it to be.  He cannot turn off the ideas and images inside him.  They provide a source of certainty, but they are not sufficient for the certainty he eventually wants.
