# Descartes continued

Judgement:  The same wax exists.

When I distinguish the wax from its outer forms.  Take the clothes off as it were.  The extensible, flexible, mutable thing is hidden by its outward qualities.  Even if it isn't there, I think it is there, so I know my mind has to exist.  Even if I don't know if bodies exist.


Descartes is initially jubilant about that.

Descartes knows Galileo was commanded to go to Rome and meet wiht important clerical figures to put it gently.  Galileo said Copernicus was right so the church was wrong.  And some people in the church were furious.  The upshot of the visit to Rome was that after Galileo (who was a physician, astronomer, businessman, physicist) was shown the rack (torture instrument) he decided to go along with the church.  Then Galileo allegedly signed a thing that said he wouldn't talk about Copernicus ideas anymore.

So Descartes is very careful.  He isn't mentioning Copernicus, but he does defend the new science.  The world is made of mathematically describable 'matter'.

Descartes says that the wax example was not a good way to describe the situation.  All he is willing to say now is that these qualities are images made of complexes of elements.  These qualities are now being called modes of thinking that are within Descartes.

Descartes switches models of perception.

Galileo has passages where he says things like "the bible doesn't tell us how the heavens go, it tells us how to go to heaven"

Descartes wants to put forth the view that we live in a scientifically describable world and the world that we perceive is NOT that scientifically percieved.  World is filled with ideas within us that we believe are  created by the science.

World as we perceive it has images and ideas - macro level.  Micro level is mathematical.

Descartes wants to know how we 'know' something.

He says what you see here and now is that a blue square is a blue square.  So he says knowledge comes from a 'seeing' of something.

Descartes is certain that he is a thinking thing.  What leads him to certainty?

Whatever Descartes sees clearly and distinctly is true.


Descartes gives us two rules:
- Whatever I perceive clearly and distinctly is true.
- Whatever I conceive clearly and distinctly is true.
Descartes thinks he is on better footing with the perceive notion.
Descartes doesn't pay enough attention to contrast between perceive and conceive.

Descartes sees ideas and thoughts of the things outside him.

We see ideas and images of things, but we don't know for sure if they are there.  We never perceive scientific bodies that make everything up.


When we look at things we never see _all_ the things that make something up.

We believe in bodies but we never perceive them.  We only perceive what is in our mind.  The world outside of us is outside in such a way that none of our perceptions are of it.  Our perceptions are all images caused by that world.

In the 2nd meditation Descartes reaches a certainty about what is within himself or in his mind.  He wants foundations for science and the physical world, which isn't likely just by studying himself.

Demon or no demon, Descartes is convinced that 2+3=5 and that he exists.  But then he backs away from that.

Having to think a certain way is a fact about Descartes's mind.  He can only know what is in his mind.


All the certainty in Descartes's mind doesn't address any certainty about a physical world.  All he knows is when he thinks about them, he thinks about them mathematically, but that doesn't show there are any such things.

Geometry and arithmetic are so convincing that descartes believes them.  But he wants to apply them to a physical world, but he doesn't know if he can.

He is only certain of things within his mind (right now just arithmetic and geometry).  Is there a world that conforms to the way he has to think?  He doesn't know yet.  Maybe the demon gave him those thoughts.

This is why he wants to prove there is a good god.  Because if he can prove that, he knows the god wouldn't deceive him.  And therefore if it takes a physical world of this sort to make math be true.  Because god gave him math ideas, Descartes knows god created a world to match it.

What does Descartes get out of god?  Ultimately, he gets that a physical world exists.

Next time: Pick out essential elements of third meditation where he proves existence of god. Read third meditation.
