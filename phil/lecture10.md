# Wittgenstein continued..

## "I'll teach you differences"

## "Don't think; look and see!"

W thinks he thought too much in his early days.

Don't just think, but combine thinking with looking and seeing.

It's tolerably clear, I think that when you read W's Lecture on Ethics, he isn't giving you an empirical report.  He is giving you a way of thinking and looking at the world.  It's an approach to the world that he brings to his thinking and writing about the world.  Not something W discovered in the world.

W considers the case of Hamlet as one way of saying, "Okay, I'll grant you ethics is not in the world, but I want to insist that ethics is within subjects, within selves."  

W says "When you look inside yourself, no matter what the pain or anguish or fury about for example a murder, all you find within yourself is facts, facts and more facts."

Hamlet and Kant say you find morality within yourself.  W says horsefeathers, you find the same thing you find outside, facts facts facts.

It's not clear that that is an empirical report so much as a restatement of the fact that the world consists of facts.  

W accuses the younger W of thinking too much instead of looking and seeing.  He doesn't take other views into account, just asserts his own. 

It's probably true of all of us that we rarely either just think of just look and see.  We live with a mixture of the two.  

### The ambiguity of language
"Green is green."

It could be that the color green is green.  Or it could be that Mr. Green is envious.  The signs that we look at don't tell us what exactly the signs are symbolizing.  We can't tell whether it refers to a person, color, fresh, new, or emotional attitude.

The reason our ordinary language could be improved is we could eliminate ambiguities like this if we designed a language in which each sign symbolized only one thing because in the English language (and most other natural languages) one sign symbolizes many different things in some instances.  I'm not the only Ryan! 

The early W wants to teach you differences and wants you to look and see that everyday language has problems.  And he wants you to think about how to eliminate these problems.  

### Fact/Value Distinction:
Around the time W is doing his work, other people are getting excited about the *Fact/Value* distinction. 

There's a difference between how the world _is_ and how it _ought_ to be.

As part of W's originality, one of the things we saw in the Lecture on Ethics is that isn't what intrigues W.  What intrigues W is the (is/are) vs (always, everywhere, necessarily).

Every proposition or its negation would be in the world book, but not both.  Never both.  P or not P gets at a very general, logical characteristic of the world, which always and everywhere is the case.  There are no contradictions is another way to put it.  

What interests W as much as anything about values is their necessity.  It's always wrong to lie.  It's always right to want to be honest.  We can add 'no exceptions possible' to get W's thinking.

W thinks Logic has that group of characteristics in common with Ethics.  And people don't usually think Logic and Ethics should be assimilated to that degree.  That's a hallmark of W's thinking.  Kant did think some similar things though.  BUT, W says inside is different from outside, opposite of Kant who says moral values come from within. 


The W thinks, the important thing for putting Logic in the same category of Ethics is the features above, not the subject matter, because he would be the first to say Logic has no/all subject matter.  The scaffolding of the world is the subject of Logic.  

So, Ethics and Logic share something even though they go in different directions.

Early W and late W both see problems in languages.  Monk is good in quoting W's remark that ordinary language is just fine as it is, but he clearly doesn't think that.  What W means is that he is going to show how to eliminate these problems of ambiguity by talking about a different kind of language that doesn't have these characteristics.  Thus, you would be able to solve our problems.  In the early work, his attention is on designing or at least thinking about a language that only has one sign for each symbol.  An injective language function :D  

When W says our current language is okay, he is saying that we could solve these problems in English by refining our English.  Later W gets more interested in understanding how complex language is, and how many different kinds of jobs language does.


There's a place in the Tractatus where W says "If you're looking at Logic and you want to go off in the world, you're on the wrong track."  That's early W as opposed to late W who wants you to look and see.

Late W still thinks language could use improvement, but he thinks we could do stuff to become more aware of the ambiguities and how to avoid them.  


The world in its totality is just facts.  So when W begins the Tractatus with the claim "The world is the totality of facts." none of those propositions would be in the world book because none is a factual claim about how particular things are in the world.  If the measure of making sense is in the world book, those opening props of the tractatus are nonsense.
