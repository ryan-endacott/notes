# Wittgenstein continued


Different language games designed to get you to realize different things.

There are so many more aspects to language than just fact stating.  I don't think he says we never use language for fact stating.  I think he says that even when we use language for fact stating, there are a lot of other things beside the sentence that matter.

Language is vastly more complex than W thought, and to understand how it is, we must study it more.

Even personality has to do with how language functions, because what advice you get is not just factual even when the matter is just factual.  It can have to do with the temperament of the person giving the advice.  It was Evann Presley's personal concern about allergies that made her want to give Don an epipen.  She put that concern on others.

The way you portray facts is significant as well.  Here was Evann giving me a recommendation: "Carry an epipen all the time." She was projecting her concerns onto Don.  Original question was "Why do we look at different language games?"  "Why is it so important to look at language games?"  Well, because there are so many subtleties and nuances in the way information is handled/presented/believed/acted on that those are important for _even_ the portraying of factual information.

W thinks there is not a private language, Russell thinks there is.

Bottom of page 92 is important.

There are two notions of supernatural.  D tried to convince us that W believes that logic and ethics are not somethings, but not nothings either.  In other words, ethics is not something that involves just facts, and logic is not something that involves facts at all.  It is the scaffolding of facts, but it is not itself a set of facts.  Personality traits and brittleness are in the universe as opposed to say, god.  But they are not facts in the universe.  D was trying to convey that sometimes W thinks the important things (things he is mosted interested in), logics and ethics, are not facts among facts, but they are connected with facts in some way, or they are totally outside the universe.

Here is what D is working on.  Logic and ethics for W are not *something* they are not there in the factual work to be talked about with language.  (remember language only talks about facts).  Ethics and logic are not factual.  But he doesn't think they are nothing.  He tells the editor that he cannot say ethics, but it is the most important part.  We are in a cage trapped by language and we want to get out of it to talk about ethics but he can't because it is nonsense.

In the early work, there is a strong interest in the material that is not something describable in the universe but it is not nothing either.  It is really important.  D thinks that one of the reasons he wrestles with private language is that he convinces himself that our feelings, sensations, etc, are a very important part of hte universe but language as we use it is essentially a public phenomenon.  Here are the words, here is what they talk about.  And that is exactly what we cannot do.  We can't say here is the word for pain and now I'll show you my pain.  I can't show you my pain.  Our sensations are very much part of the universe but we can't use a public language to talk about them at all.  We can't use the model of name and object, because we cannot publicly display our private feelings.

Even in W's later philosophy where he gives up on ethics and logic altogether.  He still finds somethings that cannot be talked about in the way that you can talk about the student center, etc. That is an echo of the Tractatus doctrine of how some things can be said but not shown.

You could find some philosophers like Russell who believe that originally, all of us have to work with is our own private sensations.  And we construct a public world out of our private sensations.  Descartes says he never experiences a body, only his own images of bodies, etc.  W is worried that that kind of view is so at odds with the way the world is that it is a classic philosopher's mistake.  The way to undermine that mistake is to show that on that view, language is not even possible.  If all we have to work with are private experiences, then we couldn't have the community of language use that we do have.  So it's a kind of reductio of that view that all of us only have private sensations.  W says we can't have language on that view, and we do have language as a communal affair that involves public objects and agreements on how to use objects for that.  What he also believes is pain behavior vs pain behavior plus pain.  W says that the behavior is NOT all that counts.  The pain of a person is something that makes genuine pain behavior different from an actor expressing pain during a play.  There is a real difference, but it is the kind of difference that cannot be shown publicly.  So it is not a something, but it is not a nothing either.  It's part of what makes W so fascinating, because he doesn't wanna deny that.  But he still thinks there is a colossal difference in the way feelings enter language as opposed to public material things like statues.

So there is no private language because we cannot deal with it in the same way and talk about it in the fact world.  We use public language to express sensations but we cannot name them using the model using name and objects.


When W wrote the Tractatus, W didn't tell you much about the domain of the mind.   Now W will talk about consciousness in the way we talk about it in everyday life.  Consciousness.  Consciousness the way we do in everyday life not as a philosophical theory.


Supernatural
 - world of facts
 - outside the universe of logic
