At the end of the Descartes dream discussion he wants to claim that it looks like the dream discussion doesn't affect mathematics.  It still seems indubitable to him even after the dream discussion.  Then he says suppose there is an all-powerful demon who creates me with those ideas but doesn't create a physical world so there is no proper subject matter to apply the math, etc to.  So that is his first doubt about mathematics.  So at the end of the 1st meditation mathematics has a special place of seeming to be true.  Being kind of difficult to doubt, but he doubts mathematics nonetheless.

In the 3rd meditation he says the same thing.  Mathematics seems so indubitable.  Demon or no demon he bursts out saying nobody can fool him, but then he says though this doubt is very slight and metaphysical it must be eliminated.  And in order to eliminate it he must prove that a good god exists.  Math is in a special place in Descartes' mind.  It is dubitable but is held in indubitable place.  The indubitability is due to god's having placed.  In 4th and 5th meditation he says he knows god placed the beliefs within him.

Special place for math which seems to put them beyond doubt but in the end doesn't put them beyond doubt.  B/c to put them beyond doubt he must prove a good god exists.  He says that god puts ideas in his mind.  He feels ideas that he feels with necessity.



Everything has a cause.  So descartes says if he exists something else must exist.  He wants to determine if it is a good god or an evil genius.  He gets in the proof of god's existence b/c he is interested in the nature of that god.  He says he is imperfect and if he knows that he must have idea of perfection and he can't generate that idea so it must come from a perfect being so the cause of him must be a perfect being not an evil genius.




Strawson:
Strawson wants us to realize that whatever views we hold are relative to some beginning point or framework that we use.

Ex:  So if we deny there are values in the world then it may be b/c we believe there are just facts facts facts in the world.

Strawson says he wants to naturalize that we begin with certain points of view, such as there is a physical world.  And we take that as a given and we don't argue about it.  It's just a part of our thinking.

So when you say you don't find a view that is Strawson's, you're right. He doesn't specify his beginning point.  He says a common beginning point is that there is a physical world and bodies.


Strawson is about role of our belief in talking about the world.  Beginning beliefs vs beliefs coming from those beginning beliefs.




Descartes pulls out a package of necessarily connected ideas and that existence is among those.  He compares that with pulling out the mountain/valley idea.  Which has the idea of a mountain is necessarily connected with the idea of a valley.  And he says notice a couple of things.  He cannot think of a mountain without a valley.  He cannot think of god except as existing.

Now the mountain/valley objection is that just b/c I can't think of a mountain without a valley doesn't show that there are any mountains or valleys.  Because Decartes' thought imposes no necessity on things.  Likewise it would seem to be also true that because he cannot think of god except as existing doesn't show that there must be any thing, god, that exists.
And now Descartes gets a little loose.  But then he tightens up in a way. Loose:  He says notice, the only idea in my mind that has existence as a necessary component is the idea of god.  And then he says the mountain/valley objection would imply that you cannot infer that god exists from the fact that we have to think of god as existing.  B/c his thought imposes no necessity on things.
He does wanna say in the god and m/v case his thought does not impose necessity on things.  He will try to answer the objection and explain why god case is different.

Though existence makes the idea of god case special, it doesn't respond to mountain/valley case.  page 54 of descartes book.
It is not that my thought makes this happen or imposes necessity on anything(m/v objection).  On the contrary, the necessity of the reality itself, namely, of god's existence, makes me think this way.  So the reality imposes a necessity on Descartes's mind instead of vice versa.  NOt that I can go from idea to thing, it is from thing to idea.  Only place he could get idea is from God.


The idea is of such unique nature that it could only come from god.  He can infer that god had to have existed in order for Descartes to have this thought.

Perfection, omniscience, omnipotence, and existence are necessarily connected ideas about god.






We change considerably as we age, yet we want to say that we are the same person.

GO OVER WAX EXAMPLE.
The wax example is meant to say we watch something change we want to say it is the same thing even as it undergoes tremendous change.  The wax example is so interesting to descartes b/c ALL of the sensible qualities have changed.  Then he says "Would we agree the same thing remains?  Yes.  We would all agree."  Then like a good philosopher he says we have the problem of sameness and difference.  We see that the wax remains the same.  Then descartes says what is going on here?  If all of the sensible qualities have changed we are not literally seeing the same thing.  Then he says when we say we see the same thing we are judging that something remains the same in spite of the changed qualities.  He says what remains is a body.  A flexible, extendable, movable thing.  We are not 'seeing', we are 'judging' that the same thing remains.
So now we are in the position of what is observable and that all the qualities have changed.  We say we see the same thing when we are actually judging the same thing remains.

What remains of the wax is that it is extendable, flexible, mutable, etc.


Body qualities:
- Extension
- flexible
- mutable,
