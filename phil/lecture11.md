# Wittgenstein continued.


Monk says W's view of philosophy is 'giving elucidation to get clear on issues, whatever the issues may be.'  If you think about it, it's not hard to see why if your goal is to get people clear about issues, you may not need to say anything.  W is not putting forth claims in the Tractatus, but rather trying to get clear on issues.
Don: What I mixed with that is this talk about thinking vs looking and seeing.  when I talked about thinking vs looking and seeing.  In Tractatus, W thought about what the world was like, and the goal was to get the reader to realize that if the world is facts facts more facts and you've stated all the facts, then it looks like you've said all you need to say.  And that's why the notion of the world book is in the lecture on ethics.  If you say all that can be said, then you'll follow #7 in Tractatus and will have spoken about all you can speak and will be silent about all else.

If you have the world book at hand, everything else is nonsense.  You've said all that can be said.  And attempts that can be said otherwise are nonsense.

## W's notion of getting clear:  "Don't think, look and see!"
Tied to W's view of what the world is like.  In his later work, he says "Don't think, rather, look and see."

At best, W would say his view on language in Tractatus is a correct view of part of language.

W wants to say that there is a lot more involved in language than just stating the facts.

"The better the philosopher, the poorer the person." - D

Fred Dredsky was widely reputed to be a very wise man.  Don saw his obituary last night.

W came to see that not every thing about the world is propositional.  Some of it is gestural.  So he came to believe his early insistence that the only way communication was by propositions that communicate facts was wrong. Don's wife smile example.

Disintegration of logical form:  Monk talks about how W changed his views because of Ramsey.  Ramsey convinced W that his logical atoms were not independent.  He said his color example depends on facts in the world.  W says he was wrong in Tractatus.  He said something being two colors at once was wrong b/c it's a contradiction.  Now he thinks he needs a different kind of logical contradiction, exclusion.  He defines contradiction and tautology in terms of truth tables and introduces a new logical sign, exclusion, and a new truth table for the logical sign exclusion.  The important part about giving up Tractatus is also that he now sees that necessity and impossibility are tied to content.  They are not just matters of logic anymore.

W had grown up with Russell who taught that logic is about the general structure of the world no matter what its content.  Now, uh-oh, some logical connectives have to do with the fact that there are colors in the world, and that's a really big move away from the doctrine of the tractatus.

Russell convinced people that logic was a subject matter of its own, like Tractatus claimed:
Logic is the scaffolding of the world, and it is there in the world, it is everywhere in the world, but it is not a particular thing in the world.

Sometimes when W looks out at the world, he sees not the particulars, but that the world is a structured world of facts, and the particular facts are no the important thing.  In the preface to the Tractatus that Russell wrote (W didn't want it published),  Russell says that W has moved toward mysticism. W said to that, "horsefeathers!  I haven't moved toward mysticism. I've moved toward seeing the structure of the universe.  And the structure of the universe is embedded in all the facts of the universe.  The facts are its scaffolding.  It is everywhere in the universe.  You cannot escape it!"

Connecting chinese room to W.  You don't learn facts in the tractatus, you look at how the world is represented.

Tractatus is broken by:
This spot is blue, so it cannot be red.  Which suddenly has to do with colors, so we have a new kind of impossibility.

If you're one height, you cannot be another height.  So some heights exclude other heights.  So it became clear to W that impossibility is not just a logical matter, it is a part of the world.  Because it can depend on colors, heights, etc, all stuff in the world.


p or not p is always, necessarily true.  It is a tautology.
p and not p is always, necessarily false.  It is a contradiction.

If some propositions are by their very form are always true or always false.  And in between are propositions which can be true or false, you have a logical scheme for impossibility, necessary truth, and possibility.  So logic says some propositions are necessarily true, some propositions are necessarily false, and some can be true or false.  That expresses W's idea of necessary truth, necessary falsity, and possible truth. That is the logic of propositions stated as simply as possible, and it tells you that necessary truth and necessary falsity have to do with the structure of a proposition, not its content.  Notice that no particular factual claims have been made.  But the notions of necessity truth or necessity, necessary falsehood or impossibility, or possible truth have been made clear.  If I make a claim about colors.  In addition to logical impossibility, you need a concept of factual impossibility.  Ex: Two colors in same place.  No longer just logic.  It is about logic and color (or content of the world).

## I'll teach you differences!

## The world is all that is the case [facts, facts, and more facts]
