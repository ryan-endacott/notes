# Wittgeinstein questions

logic is the form/structure of facts.

According to the later W, it is important to see the connection among facts.

To say the glass is brittle is different from it breaking.
Clockable event vs characteristic/disposition

Don't just think; look and see.

It is a way of presenting facts.

A picture is a representation


False, the world is the totality of facts, not of things.

According to W, logic is
a. knowing right from wrong
b.  way of understanding something
c. structure of facts - this one is prob right
d. pparticular facts

Language games help us understand complexities of language.

Compare late to early W.  Essay question.

A logical picture of a fact is a thought.

A proposition is a truth proposition.


Not every picture is a proposition, but for W, every proposition (except contradiction and tautology) is a picture of reality.

Whereof one cannot

Explain how logic and ethics relate and where W puts them in his world view.


Explain how signs become symbols.

W did too much thinking in his earlier work and not enough seeing.


Ramsey

What is the fact/value distinction

what is the measure of making sense

how do language games play a part in our world

why does W say there is no private language; give example

Lack of correspondence between picture and real world is nonsense.

A picture is articulated because it has relations in it.

A lot of work is done by things in addition to the words we use.  W's earlier picture of language is relatively simple and straightforward.  We attach names to things, we have rules for making combinations of names, and the combinations of names that we make represent corresponding connections amongst objects named by the names in the propositions we make.  His picture theory is relatively simplistic.

Names attach to things, and that's how language comes to be meaningful.

W comes to realize that in everyday language we can make propositions in many different ways (sometimes just w hand gestures or looks, etc).

W comes to realize that we do a lot of linguistic behavior that does not conform to anything like the tractatus model.  To put it slightly differently:  If you want to see how language actually functions, not how an ideal, carefully-designed language created to solve philosophical problems works.  How everyday language looks.  Look and see and don't try to constrain what you see into the model of language in the Tractatus. the more we study everyday language, the more we see that it fails to conform to the logical prototype of language that W offered in the Tractatus.


So much of our communication is nonverbal.

Sometimes you get the impression that W thinks his earlier views were too simplistic.  Other times you get the impression he thinks they were all wrong.  Don thinks it is good to talk about both ways of thinking about his earlier views.  The ideal way of reading his work is to read Tractatus and later work in one volume.  It is clear W thinks there are mistakes in the first work .  He never tells us if he thinks it is all wrong or just some.  He says in the preface to the investigations that there were grave mistakes made in the Tractatus.

W put some constraints on language but they are not applicable across the whole board.

With regards to behaviorism, W says he of course makes a distinction between pain and pain behavior.  So by that standard, W says he is not a behaviorist.

W certainly wants to say the of course he is not a behaviorist who denies that there are feelings.  He thinks distinguishing behavior accompanied by feelings vs behavior unaccompanied by feelings is very important.

W may be considered a behaviorist because he thinks that sensations don't enter language the way public objects do.  I can't show you my feelings of honor, pleasure, etc.  He can't show you the way languages and feelings hook up the way he can show you the position of an object.  So some people think he is saying there is no such hookup.  But W's view is that the hookup is through the behavior. He certainly believes in the hookup.

Behaviorism is "there is nothing to people as far as language and what they're like goes except for their behavior.  There are no mental processes, etc.  "  So when I tell you how I feel, a behaviorist thinks I am just talking.  We are only what can be publicly observed about our body.  All there is to people is their behavior.

Searle railed against behaviorism.
Sartre didn't directly rail against it, but he said stuff has to do with inner subjective states.  Sartre and Searle believe the inner conscious states that are not public but are in some sense private do exist.


W was made uncomfortable by other people.  Meaning, sometimes sheer number of people made W uncomfortable.  And the way people behave bothered him too.  That is why he spent a lot of time alone (living in a hut in Norway).  And he found people detracted from his ability to think clearly.  He was much more able to function in one-on-one situations or in small groups.  Hence the blue book program where he told people to give his lectures and gave them his notes in a blue book that was then taken around the world and lectured.

W came to regret not so much the circulation of the blue book, but the circulation meant he wasn't always there to explain what he meant so people misunderstood him.  "My vanity was stung, I had to deal with my views in watered down and mangled ways.  "

It was odd that W put his views out there with the public even though he was so private and contained.


W thinks 'bigger is better' is mindless.  He wants to ask more important questions.

W thinks of a commitment to progress "bigger is better" is bad.  He thinks the more important values (is it better?) are lost.  He thinks science has become an idol for a lot of people.  It teaches you how to do things, but it doesn't teach you the value that traditional culture teaches you like being honest, asking ethical questions, asking is progress good, asking is bigger always better, etc.

W hates British Academia.


What happened to W personally is: so he writes Tractatus, thinking he solved all problems of philosophy.  So he lives up to that view and then teaches kids (it was a disaster, he hated it).  One of the things he learns from teaching kids is that he has to deal with the kids and their parents.  Don thinks it is as if at a round age, he is doing the teaching of the grammar school students in his thirties.  He was also a soldier in WWI and comes back from war a totally different person.  W suddenly realized how much he was ignoring other people and how many issues were tied up with being in touch with other people and so he starts looking around himself and seeing.  W thinks people should be concerned with values, not just with progress.


W says don't be cryptic if you want people to understand you, behave in a way that they can understand you.  If you want themt o know there is something important in the other room, don't lock it.  Tell them.  Be up front and candid with people.  Don't play games with people.  Those that will understand something will seek it out and find it.


An inner process stands in need of outer criteria.

The only way to inner mental states, sensations is via outward behavior.  That is what W thinks and means by above statement.

W thinks we have to determine people's feelings by their outward behavior because we do not have access to their inner behavior.

The way inner processes enter our language games is via the displays of those inner processes.  And he says he is not a behaviorist.  He says he has inner processes, you just can't directly view them.

Even when they directly tell you their feelings you are learning their inner processes by behavior.
